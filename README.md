<h2>German Modules</h2>
As of this moment several modules are in the making. We will inform you as soon as they will be available.

## Other Recommended Modules
The following modules are recommended for the best gaming experience:
- [Dice So Nice!](https://gitlab.com/riccisi/foundryvtt-dice-so-nice) - Shows beautiful 3d dice on every roll. A must have! DSK fully integrates this module.
- [VTTA Tokenizer](https://github.com/mrprimate/vtta-tokenizer) - Lets you create beautiful Tokens. DSK sets up token frames for the Tokenizer on the first time the module gets activated.
- [Dice Tray](https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/foundry-vtt-dice-calculator) - If you want to do quick die rolls without knowing foundry's chat syntax. Not needed for advanced users.
- [times-up](https://gitlab.com/tposney/times-up) - Automatically expires buffs and debuffs on actors
